## Projects Included

### 1. **Predicting Crime Rate in Chicago**

**Objective**:
To predict the number of crimes in various areas of Chicago using historical crime data, assisting with crime prevention and resource planning.

**Key Steps**:

* Load and preprocess Chicago crime dataset.
* Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
* Perform feature engineering.
* Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression).
* Evaluate the model using accuracy metrics.

**Tools & Libraries**:

* `pandas`, `numpy` – Data processing
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
* `scikit-learn` – Machine learning and metrics

**Sample Outputs**:

* Correlation heatmaps
* Crime trend analysis per area
* Model evaluation reports

### 2. **Avocado Prices Prediction**

**Objective**:
To forecast avocado prices using historical sales data, helping suppliers and retailers make better inventory and pricing decisions.

**Key Steps**:

* Load avocado sales dataset.
* Perform data cleaning and feature transformation.
* Analyze sales trends and seasonality.
* Train a regression model to predict future prices.
* Visualize predictions and evaluate accuracy.

**Tools & Libraries**:

* `pandas`, `numpy` – Data wrangling
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – EDA and trend plots
* `scikit-learn` – Regression modeling

**Sample Outputs**:

* Price trend plots by region
* Feature importance charts
* Model performance metrics (MAE, R²)

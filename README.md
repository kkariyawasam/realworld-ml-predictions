# Predict Crime Rate in Chicago

This project uses data analysis and machine learning to predict crime rates in different areas of Chicago. The aim is to analyze past crime data and build a predictive model to assist with crime prevention strategies and urban planning.

## Overview

The notebook performs:

* Data loading and preprocessing of Chicago crime dataset.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
* Feature engineering and transformation.
* Building and training a regression model to predict the number of crimes.
* Evaluation of model performance.

## Techniques Used

* Pandas, NumPy for data processing
* Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualization
* Scikit-learn for machine learning models and metrics
* Linear Regression (or another regression algorithm depending on the notebook)

## Sample Outputs

* Correlation heatmaps
* Area-wise crime trend plots
* Model accuracy scores and predictions
